This app is my first attempt at creating an app myself using some new gems I hadn't tried before like cancan and devise. The gist of the app is to have a place to upload documents. 

There are two roles, one admin and many users. Users have the ability to manipulate their own documents (create or delete them) and manipulate their own user details.

The admin can do all those things as well as create and manipulate new users and their settings.
